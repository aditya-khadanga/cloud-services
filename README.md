Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a powerful, managed Kubernetes service that allows you to deploy containerized applications at scale. In this blog, we‚Äôll walk through how to provision a GKE cluster using Terraform, an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool that helps automate the entire process.
Whether you're a DevOps engineer, cloud enthusiast, or just starting out, this guide will give you hands-on knowledge of deploying production-ready infrastructure on GCP.
Deploying a GKE cluster using Terraform is a clean and reusable way to manage infra as code.
Here's a full step-by-step guide using Terraform. ( we will perform everything is Google Cloud Shell)

**‚úÖ Prerequisites**

1. Google Cloud account with billing enabled
2. Terraform installed ( install it in Google cloud shell)
3. gcloud CLI installed & configured. and Enable the APIs ( Compute Engine, Service usage, Kubernetes)
4. A service account with permissions (Kubernetes Engine Admin, Compute Admin, etc.)

**‚úÖ Final Thoughts**
Using Terraform to deploy GKE clusters allows you to manage Kubernetes infrastructure declaratively, reproducibly, and at scale.
With just a few configuration files, you can spin up or destroy entire clusters, which is especially powerful for CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure automation.
